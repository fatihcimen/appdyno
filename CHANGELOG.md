# Changelog

## 0.5.0

- Packaging: `scripts/install.sh` installs the MCP server and the `appdyno` command from this
  checkout; the package carries the prebuilt Android agent and the iOS runner's sources (built once on
  first use where no build is). One version for every part, checked by a test.
- `appdyno doctor`: Android SDK and adb, Xcode, the runner builds, the iPhone signing, and the
  devices that are connected (adb, booted simulators, iPhones over USB).
- iOS: a system alert or sheet that came up during a settle counts as busy while it animates in; with
  that, the tap through XCTest's event synthesizer is the default (about half the time of XCUI's tap on
  a phone; `APPDYNO_FAST_TAP=0` turns it off).
- The iOS runner shows as "appdyno" with its icon on the simulator and the phone.
- The adb client starts the adb server again after every outage (another tool's `adb kill-server`
  between calls is harmless).

## 0.4.0 — real iPhone

- The runner on an iPhone over USB: re-signed for a development profile (bundle ids from the profile,
  the identity from a keychain that is only unlocked), installed when the phone has another build under
  that id, started by xcodebuild, reached through the Mac's USB multiplexer.
- Apps and links on the phone through devicectl; text as keys (the runner cannot reach the clipboard
  there).
- Animation hitches on the phone through Xcode's trace tool; a memory graph with its leaks on the
  simulator; MCP's perf_trace and perf_heap answer on iOS.

## 0.3.0 — iOS simulator

- The runner: a UI test serving the protocol on a loopback port; public snapshots with XCUI's idle
  waits off (one shim, public fallback); paste-first typing; settle from reads alone.
- Simulator perf from the Mac: memory, CPU, launch, CPU profile (the app's own functions ranked by busy
  time).
- MCP: simulators listed and driven by id.

## 0.2.0 — Android, hardened

- Settle: a tap on something that cannot react settles after 80 ms; the window stretches on a loaded
  device (slow reads, late wake-ups); stillness is proven only up to a read's start.
- Perf tools with accuracy tests: frames, frame timeline, memory, CPU, launch, CPU profile, heap dump.
- Output schemas and annotations on every tool; local CI with a latency history and regression gate.
- Real Android phones: injection permission, typing, mock location (gps, network, fused), reconnect,
  screen off and keyguard.

## 0.1.0 — Android emulator

- The on-device agent (shell user, UI automation), the wire protocol, the host library and the MCP
  server with act-and-read answers and a local policy.
